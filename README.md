## Motivation
I built this project to apply my development skills and MERN stack knowledge to real-life scenarios. The goal was to solve real-world problems related to renting cars and provide users with a seamless experience.

## Problem it Solves
This web app allows users to easily search for and rent cars of different categories without the hassle of traditional methods. It provides a user-friendly interface for renting cars, managing bookings, and exploring various car options.

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I learned how to implement authentication, work with databases, connect frontend and backend, and create interactive user interfaces. I also gained experience in handling different challenges and identified features for future improvements.
